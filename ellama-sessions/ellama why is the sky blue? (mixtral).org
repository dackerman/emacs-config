why is the sky blue?

** Ellama:
 The sky appears blue because of a process called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's
 atmosphere, it is made up of different colors, which are essentially different wavelengths of
 light. Shorter wavelengths (like violet and blue) are scattered in all directions more than longer
 wavelengths (like red, orange, and yellow).

Even though the violet light is scattered more than blue light, the sky appears blue instead of
violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and because sunlight reaches us with less
violet to start with. Additionally, some of the violet light gets absorbed by the ozone layer in the
atmosphere. The combined effect results in a blue-colored sky during the day.
