As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of different colors, which are essentially different wavelengths of light. Shorter wavelengths (like violet and blue) are scattered in all directions more than longer wavelengths (like red, orange, and yellow).

Even though the violet light is scattered more than blue light, the sky appears blue instead of violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and because sunlight reaches us with less violet to start with. Additionally, some of the violet light gets absorbed by the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The combined effect results in a blue-colored sky during the day." nil)) nil nil nil) nil)
